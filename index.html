        <h3>Education</h3>
        <h5>
          Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA
        </h5>
        <p>Ruwaida received her BS of Interdisciplinary Studies in Biomedical Science and Enterprise from Georgia State University, GA. She has completed fellowship in GSU's Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) and is currently applying for a PhD in Immunology.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          Ruwaida's research interests pertain to elucidating complex biological mechanisms and biochemical cascades that are the interactions between host and pathogen to combat infectious diseases. She has conducted her undergraduate research at Georgia State University analyzing metal starvation tactics of hosts to deprive gonococcal bacteria of nutrition. The counter attempts at metal sequestration of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a highly infectious sexually transmitted bacteria from the host is equally fascinating and has driven Ruwaida's undergraduate research goals. <br>
          <br>She has also conducted literary research on Streptococcal bacteria and their functions in maintaining metal homeostasis for improved pathogenesis. For her summer research at Harvard Medical School, Ruwaida explored a unique branch of biomedical science, known as spatial transcriptomics where she and her lab aimed to adapt novel techniques of high-throughput sequencing with CRISPR-Cas 9 deletions to better understand hostmicrobial interactions in intact tissues. <br>
          <br>Now, Ruwaida is conducting research at the National Cancer Institute to study macrophage behaviors in microbial infections to understand macrophage induced tumor-immunity suppressive roles. Her long-term goal is to understand antimicrobial resistance in pathogens to unravel mechanisms of rapid pathogenic adaptability. In the future, Ruwaida want to work with the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to develop novel vaccines and sustainable models for antibiotics.
